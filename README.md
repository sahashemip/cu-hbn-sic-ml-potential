# Defective hBN/SiC Heterostructure using VASP-NEP-GPUMD

This project provides a guide for developing **machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP)** and conducting molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with [GPUMD software](https://gpumd.org/).

This developed potential can be used to 
(i) assess the stability of the two-dimensional hBN/SiC heterostructure,
(ii) elucidate **Siâ€“N bond formation** triggered by a boron vacancy (\$V_\mathrm{B}\$),
and (iii) investigate the behaviour of **Cu adatoms** on the defective hBN/SiC surface.

## Database Compilation

Detailed instructions are provided for building a robust database (DB).
[Density-functional theory (DFT)](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-density-functional-theory.html) calculations were performed with the [Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)](https://www.vasp.at/) to obtain the total energy, atomic forces, and virial stress for each geometry.
Defects are introduced into a supercell containg 100 boron (B), 100 nitrogen (N), 64 silicon (Si), and 64 carbon (C) atoms.
Detailed information on the geometries and structures used to construct a stable interatomic potential is provided below.

#### 1. Boron Vacancy ($\rm{V}_{\rm{B}}$) Defects
**Lattice mismatch** lead to 15 symmetry-distinct \$V_\mathrm{B}\$ defects in the heterostrcuture supercell, marked by the red circles in the figure. All unique defects were created, and their geometries were optimized. Depending on the VB site, various numbers of local chemical bonds (ranging from 0 to 4) are formed. Geometry-optimization trajectories are stored in the VASP `XDATCAR` files.
- Use the script `src/vasp_structure_rattler_deformer.py` with `--max_strain 0.05`, `--max_amplitude 0.1`, and `--step_size 5` to generate `POSCAR` files from XDATCARs.
- Perform single-shot DFT calculations (potentially with higher precision) for these structures, forming a database of **2180 structures**.

#### 2. Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics for Stable Defects
- For the **most stable defect structure** (with 4 chemical bonds), ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were conducted:
  - **Temperature:** 500 K
  - **Ensemble:** NVT
  - **Duration:** 6000 steps
- Using a **step size of 10**, an additional **~600 structures** were added to the database.

#### 3. Pristine System
- For the pristine system, **120 additional structures** (pristine and rattled) were added to the database.
- The hBN layer shifts from (0,0) to (ax/2,ay/2). ax=3.09 and ay=5.35 are the rectangular SiC lattice parameters.
